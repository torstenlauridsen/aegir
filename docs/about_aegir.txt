According to norse mythology Aegir is the God for water (he is actually one of only three "jotuns" i.e. troll-like creatures, that live in Asgaard) As the God for water his main domain is the sea, but he is also the God for beer and mead, and he is supposed to be an excellent mead brewer. As a mead brewer I assume that Aegir has often wondered about the precision of his densimeter based alcohol content estimations - Especially for brews with significant residual sugar, which meads often have. I've created this project to help Aegir improve his alcohol content estimations. You are also welcome to use it if you like.
